# Highlights

- **Full lifecycle management**: manages a project during its lifecycle, including creation, development, debugging, deployment, and O&M.
- **Security release**: automatically detects the changes in functions.
- **Quick integration**: integrates with common CI/CD tools. For more information, see [CI/CD tools](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/blob/master/docs/en/cicd.md).
- **Observability**: allows you to query metrics and logs on your client. For more information, see [Query metrics](docs/en/command/metrics.md) and [Query logs](docs/en/command/logs.md).
- **Multi-mode debugging**: supports multi-mode debugging to meet different debugging requirements in the development state and O&M state. The modes include [local call](docs/en/command/local.md), [remote debugging](docs/en/command/invoke.md), and [cloud-terminal joint debugging](docs/en/command/proxied.md).
# Quick start

üôã To use the FC component, perform the following steps:    
‚ù∂ [Run the following command to install Serverless Devs](https://github.com/Serverless-Devs/Serverless-Devs/blob/master/docs/en/install.md): `npm install -g @serverless-devs/s`  
> After installation, you also need to configure the key. Please refer to [Secret Configuration Document](./en/config.md)

‚ù∑ Run the following command to initialize the `Hello World` project of Function Compute: `s init devsapp/start-fc-http-python3`          
‚ù∏ Determine whether to deploy the project. To deploy the project, enter `y` and press Enter.     

> The [Create an application](en/quick_start_application.md) topic introduces the following projects: [**Serverless: Hello World**](docs/en/quick_start_application.md#serverlesshello-world)[**Artificial intelligence: object detection**](docs/en/quick_start_application.md#AITarget-Detection), [**Traditional framework: Django-based blog project**](docs/en/quick_start_application.md#Traditional-framework-based-on-django-blog-project). The [Quick start](docs/en/quick_start_function.md) topic introduces the following features: [**deploy operation**](docs/en/quick_start_function.md#deploy-operation), [**Invoke**](docs/en/quick_start_function.md#Invoke), and [**Observability**](docs/en/quick_start_function.md#Observability).

When you use the FC component, you must edit resource description files. For more information about the YAML specifications of the FC component, see [**YAML specifications**](docs/en/yaml/readme.md). You also need to read some tips on the FC component, such as [Declaration and deployment of multiple functions](docs/en/tips.md#Declaration-and-deployment-of-multiple-functions). For more information, see [Common tips](docs/en/tips.md).

> If you are using Funcraft or Function Compute command line interface (fcli), you can view the differences among Funcraft, fcli, and Serverless Devs from [**Compare among Serverless Devs, fcli, and Funcraft**](docs/en/vs_fun_fcli.md). To migrate resources from Funcraft or fcli to Serverless Devs, see [**Migrate resources from Funcraft to Serverless Devs**](docs/en/vs_fun_fcli.md#Migrate-resources-from-Funcraft-to-Serverless-Devs) and [**Migrate resources from fcli to Serverless Devs**](docs/en/vs_fun_fcli.md#Migrate-resources-from-fcli-to-Serverless-Devs)
